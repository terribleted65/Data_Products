Coursera: Data Products Course

Assignment: Shiny App 

App: http://tedth.shinyapps.io/data_products/

Description: The Shiny App uses a random sample of company XYZ.com's product catalog to create a list of price quantiles. This app will be used by the product managers in the product catagories to monitor the pricing of their products as their customer base is very price sensitive. 

How to use: Upon starting the app using the link to the shinyapps.io site, the user will be presented with the option to select the Catalog Date and the Product Category for which to get the product price quantiles.  Each product category is made up of multiple product types and will have the price quantiles for each product type within that product category. Changing either selection will recalculate the results real time.

Catalog Date: April 23, April 30
Product Category: Apparel, Home
